<h1>performance-now <a href="https://travis-ci.org/meryn/performance-now"><img src="https://travis-ci.org/meryn/performance-now.png?branch=master" alt="Build Status"></a> <a href="https://david-dm.org/meryn/performance-now"><img src="https://david-dm.org/meryn/performance-now.png" alt="Dependency Status"></a></h1><p>Implements a function similar to <code>performance.now</code> (based on <code>process.hrtime</code>).</p>
<p>Modern browsers have a <code>window.performance</code> object with - among others - a <code>now</code> method which gives time in miliseconds, but with sub-milisecond precision. This module offers the same function based on the Node.js native <code>process.hrtime</code> function.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/">High Resolution Time specification</a>, the number of miliseconds reported by <code>performance.now</code> should be relative to the value of <code>performance.timing.navigationStart</code>. For this module, it&#39;s relative to when the time when this module got loaded. Right after requiring this module for the first time, the reported time is expected to have a near-zero value.</p>
<p>Using <code>process.hrtime</code> means that the reported time will be monotonically increasing, and not subject to clock-drift.</p>
<h2>Example usage</h2><pre><code class="language-javascript">var now = require(&quot;performance-now&quot;)
var start = now()
var end = now()
console.log(start.toFixed(3)) // ~ 0.05 on my system
console.log((start-end).toFixed(3)) // ~ 0.002 on my system
</code></pre>
<p>Running the now function two times right after each other yields a time difference of a few microseconds. Given this overhead, I think it&#39;s best to assume that the precision of intervals computed with this method is not higher than 10 microseconds, if you don&#39;t know the exact overhead on your own system.</p>
