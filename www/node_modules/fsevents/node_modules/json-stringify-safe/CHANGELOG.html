<h2>Unreleased</h2><ul>
<li>Fixes stringify to only take ancestors into account when checking
circularity.<br>It previously assumed every visited object was circular which led to <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/json-stringify-safe/issues/9">false
positives</a>.<br>Uses the tiny serializer I wrote for <a href="https://github.com/moll/js-must">Must.js</a> a year and a half ago.</li>
<li>Fixes calling the <code>replacer</code> function in the proper context (<code>thisArg</code>).</li>
<li>Fixes calling the <code>cycleReplacer</code> function in the proper context (<code>thisArg</code>).</li>
<li>Speeds serializing by a factor of
Big-O(h-my-god-it-linearly-searched-every-object) it had ever seen. Searching
only the ancestors for a circular references speeds up things considerably.</li>
</ul>
